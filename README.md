# Project-2
NFT Social Media App

NFT Social will be the premier application for sharing your personal collection of NFTs.

Upon going to the website url, the user will be prompted to either sign in or create an account. Those who create an account will be automatically signed in upon creation.

The app will pull from a OpenSea API to have live updating prices of the NFTs.

Users will be able to like and leave comments on NFT posts, and posts will have the functionality to be able to be edited and deleted.

Users can click on a MY NFTs button to view their personal collection of NFTs as well as clickable usernames to view the personal collections of other NFT owners.

Each name and NFT photo will be a clickable link to a show page with the image, price, and quantity available of the NFT. There will be an edit and delete button rendered on this page as well as funcitonality to like or leave a comment.

There will be a BUY button on the NFT show page which will decrement the quantity by one. The price of the NFT will be subtracted from the buyers available funds and added to the sellers funds.

POST-MVP GOALS:
- add in search functionality to search by NFT name or username


VERSION 2
- When uploading a new BAYC NFT, add attributes and scarcity score is auto-generated
- Like/Dislike button functionality
- Have a "Popular" button that displays a show page of the NFTs in order by most liked
- Place the NFTs into categories and have clickable categories that will show all of the NFTs that are labeled as part of that category (Ex: art, music, videos, sports, photography, etc)
- Add modals on the different pages with additional information about the NFTs (artist, different attributes, )
